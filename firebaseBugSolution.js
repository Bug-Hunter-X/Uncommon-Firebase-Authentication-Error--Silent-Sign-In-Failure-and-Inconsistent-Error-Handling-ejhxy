The solution improves error handling by adding comprehensive checks after each authentication attempt. It includes explicit checks for network errors, credential validation errors, and user cancellation events using `onAuthStateChanged` and handling the cases where the user is null.  Additionally, it provides better feedback to the user based on the specific type of failure.  The solution also uses promises and async/await for clearer and easier-to-follow error handling.  It employs a more robust approach to detect sign-in cancellation across different platforms.
