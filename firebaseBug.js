The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the authentication process.  This can be difficult to debug because the error messages aren't always clear. For example, a silent, unexpected failure might occur during a silent authentication process where the user is already signed in.  Additionally, if the user cancels the sign-in flow (e.g., closes the pop-up window), there's no consistent way to detect this cancellation without using a custom approach for handling that event. This makes it difficult to implement a robust user experience.
